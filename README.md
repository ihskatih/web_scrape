# web_scrape
This is my first shot at web scraping. It is a really convenient way to grab data from a web page and save it systematically.
I used PyCharm to run this code. 
The website I scraped from is: https://food.list.co.uk/places/what:restaurants/location:New%20England%2852.0547%2C0.4853%29/distance:50/#results
